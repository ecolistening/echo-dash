# About

This page shows species richness by time of day as predicted by BirdNET V2.4, viewable as standard scatter or scatter polar plots.

Richness is calculated the sum of unique species across all group fields. A configurable probability threshold can be adjusted to determine a positive / negative detection. This is applied uniformly across species.
