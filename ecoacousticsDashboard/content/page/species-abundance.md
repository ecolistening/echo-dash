# Species Abundance
This plot shows species abundance by time of day as predicted by BirdNET V2.4.

BirdNet V2.4 provides predictions over 3s windows. When two vocalizations from the same species appear in the same window, they are assumed to originate from different individuals. An abundance proxy is calculated as the maximum number of 'simultaneous' vocalisations detected within a window. The total within groupings are summed. A configurable probability threshold can be adjusted to determine a positive / negative detection.
