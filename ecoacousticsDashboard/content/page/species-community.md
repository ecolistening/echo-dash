# Species Matrix
This plot shows the total count of each detected species as predicted by BirdNET V2.4. BirdNET returns probabilities for each species for each audio segment. A value can be used (across all species) to adjust the detection threshold using the slider in the control panel. Detections can be grouped according to spatial and site-level categories, temporal and diel categories and functional groups.
