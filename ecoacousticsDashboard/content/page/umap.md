# About

This page displays a UMAP projection of all acoustic features grouped together. UMAP is a method of projecting high-dimensional data onto fewer dimensions using a method similar to a standard clustering algorithm, preserving the global structure of the data by maintaining the distance between individual samples while reducing the number of dimensions to 2. As such, the `x`, `y` axes themselves have no precise meaning, though can be interpreted as emphasising qualitative differences between the features extracted for each sample.
