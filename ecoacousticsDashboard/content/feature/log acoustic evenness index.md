# Log Acoustic Evenness Index
The Acoustic Evenness Index (AEI), from Villanueva-Rivera et al. 2011 (band evenness using the Gini index), is calculated by dividing the spectrogram into bins (default 10, each one of 1000 Hz) and taking the proportion of the signals in each bin above a threshold (default -50 dBFS). The AEI is the result of the Gini index applied to these bins.
