# Ecoacoustic Dashboard

Soundscape indices are being adopted in a range of long term ecological monitoring contexts.
These descriptors are appealing for their efficiency, but there remains uncertainty around their interpretation.

## Goals

ECHO aims to support solid ecological inference by providing accessible, interactive data exploration.

## Functionality

ECHO offers distinct functions to facilitate familiarisation with and interpretation of acoustic data:
* i) metadata exploration - to check your data in time and space
* ii) interactive visualisation and playback to understand changes through time and space
* iii) downloading of plots, and associated data and code - to verify patterns statistically offline
