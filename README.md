# ecoacoustics-dashboard

## Installation

There are two ways of running the Ecoacoustics Dashboard.
For ease-of-use, the dashboard can be run in Docker.
However, for development, running the Dashboard in a conda environment (or virtual environment) is preferrable as Flask can auto-reload on changes to the codebase.


### Docker

### Flask (using Anaconda)
