# ecoacoustics-dashboard

## Installation

There are two ways of running the Ecoacoustics Dashboard.
For ease-of-use, the dashboard can be run in Docker.
However, for development, running the Dashboard in a conda environment (or virtual environment) is preferrable as Flask can auto-reload on changes to the codebase.


### Docker
The Docker image is not public yet, so please use Flask. You can build your own Docker image that you can use as well if you want.

### Flask (using Anaconda)
Checkout the respository (fork, if necessary, or close) and install required python libraries using `requirements.txt`.
